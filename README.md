# SORT CSV DICTIONARY

I created this repository as an exercise for python. This python script takes the csv file created by my python web scraper and sorts the data alphabetically by 'author' and produces a new sorted csv file.

DEPENDENCIES:<br/>
(1) csv

INSTRUCTIONS:<br/>
(1) Download repo<br/>
(2) run `python sort_scrape.py`
